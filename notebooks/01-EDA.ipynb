    "   - These households are also the highest spender on Miscellaneous and Non-Essential expenditures compared to other income sources. This is likely because they have a stable source of income thus allowing more leeway in term of their spending.\n",
    "2. Farming and Livestock monetary sources are self sufficient\n",
    "   - Hoesedolds' that earns their keep from farming and livestock have weak correlation with most of the expenditure categories likely because they consume what they produce, thus reducing their need to purchase foods. Another reason is that their source of income are seasonal and unpredictable, thus requiring them to be cautios on their spending.\n",
    "   - Despite their low spending, they have negative correlation with Non-Food Essential Expenditures likely becuase of abused selling price of their priducts.\n",
    "3. Logistics, Manufacturing, Entrep. Activities, and Passive Income earners spend invests their money\n",
